# Django Project: CV Generator & Recipe Finder with OpenAI API

This Django-based project contains two apps that leverage OpenAI’s API with a free large language model (LLM) to generate dynamic outputs based on user input:

## 🛠️ Project Overview

- **CV Generator App**  
  Allows users to fill out a form with personal and professional details, then generates a customized CV using an OpenAI-powered LLM.

- **Recipe Finder App**  
  Users provide a list of ingredients, and the app uses OpenAI’s LLM to generate recipe suggestions dynamically.

Both apps interact with the OpenAI API to generate text outputs.

## ⚙️ Features

- Interactive form for CV creation with immediate AI-generated results
- Ingredient-based recipe generation powered by AI
- Django backend handling form submissions, API requests, and response rendering
- Modular apps for easy maintenance and scalability
